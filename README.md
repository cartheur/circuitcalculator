# The Electromagnetic Circuit Calculator - Experimenter's Laboratory
A work-in-progress trying to compute the theoretical operational parameters of an electromagnetic circuit.

I started this project back in 2010, in order to capture the plethora of details which consist a simple wireless-powered circuit, like the one shown in a figure located in the data folder of this repository.

This project was a big help in that I was able to come to terms with wireless power as a phenomenon and be able to organize the details sufficiently in order to generate publications.
